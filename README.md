# Website Design  

The theme of our website is "UFO recordings". Through this website, the users can:

- Record the appearance of UFOs, such as when and where, shapes and duration of UFOs etc. after they sign up/in;  
- Users can also search the UFO records from the website. The results will be returned in tabular format; 


Based on this theme, the main steps we implemented are as follow:  

- Drafted the layout of our homepage and created different modules on the left bar of the homepage. To implement the search function, we added MariaDB connections via PHP to query among massive tables using PuTTY. 
- Connected to remote MariaDB server using PuTTY; Implemented query functionanlity to connect and retrieve data among massive tables.
- Generated reactive HTML pages and showcased the summary in tabular forms with CSS pagination to make it scrollable.
- Invoked mysql_connect() and mysql_close() functions via PHP to enable interactions with HTML.
